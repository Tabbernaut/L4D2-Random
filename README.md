L4D2-Random
============

Plugins for making Random config possible. WIP.

Yes, I know a lot of this code is ugly. Random started out as a bit of a joke, then slowly grew out to a fairly serious config.  If I have time to spare, I might try and clean this up, but for now it will have to do.

Anyway, this plugin has a single purpose: it is the engine that powers the Random config. It is not designed to be used in other contexts, hence its functions being clumped together and intertwined as they are.

The parts that do serve more general purposes and may well be of use for other projects/configs are separate and found under my L4D2 Plugins repository:
- Saferoom Detect (to detect whether players, entities or coordinates are inside the bounds of a saferoom)
- Penalty Bonus (a non-survival bonus system that uses the defib. penalty)
