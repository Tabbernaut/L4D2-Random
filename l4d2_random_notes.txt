L4D2_Random
===========

    event ideas:
    ------------
            
            in consideration
            ----------------
            - 'witch hunt': spawns many witches all over the place -- only way to score points = by killing them [pbonus]
                    consider it a 'miniwitches': give them 50% health, 50 dmg claw?
            - 'time penalty': every minute played gives a 25 point penalty on the round score
            - 'pistol round': only pistols (magnums included). No locked doors and easier ci/si. [maybe]
            - gnome VIP: only one gnome spawns (start saferoom), it must be brought or the end saferoom won't close
                or: gnome heaven, where the only way to score (many) points is to bring gnomes
                - for example: given only 1 gnome: distance points are frozen unless gnome is held
            - weird SI: random SI abilities (CRox's code) -- just give every SI a random ability...
            - axe effect / rockstar [stab]
                everyone gets an axe/guitar, all common are female, no tank only spitters and boomettes
            - clockwork: clockwork timed spawns, deaths, rinse repeat (no tank?)
            - quad damage [stab]
                one player gets special glow / sound => deals 4* damage
                tag-game: SI and survivors get quad, it switches when one hits another
            
            rejected
            --------
            - 'fallen survivor hunt'
            
            
    to-do:
    ------
            - bugfix:   intro maps (and quite likely, only then?) get weird stuff spawning in saferooms sometimes
                        [ testing ]
                        
            - bugfix:   changes to sv_time_of_day (or whatever) are reported (being tracked by confogl. test with multiwitches
                        [ testing ]
                        
            - bugfix:   hud looks weird on defib event (health bars are empty, but health is normal and full)

            - medium:   bot si spawn determination?
                        - or check if I can simply force the spawns just like human players (IsFakeClient() checks?)
                        - consider allowing bots in matchmode too, because.. why not?
          
            - low:      ammo event: when someone dies, shortly after: check if there exists an upgrade pack anywhere
                            either in possession of players or on the map -- if not, generate one near the corpse.

            - low:      stripper-dir switch randomly: so maps automatically have two versions
                        - dec3 long way around vs. normal
                        - par3 random maze versions
                        
            - low:      randomize location for gascans in scavenge finales
                            that is, find all the locations, get the total amount of cans and redistribute them
                            *near* every spawn location with random variance (then remember for next round)
            
            - low:      fix campaign mode random:
                        - remove items that the survivors bring and use all items in the map? fix for events
            
            - code:     "The SetEntProp functions have a parameter for the array index, use it instead of doing manually lookups and computing offsets."
            - code:     Clean up the explosion timer/particles code a bit.
            - code:     Clean up the l4d_drop copied code some more.
            
            
    ideas:
    ------
        
            - ?     - gift idea: key reversal effect, briefly. (negative effect)
            - ?     - gift idea: X second slowdown (like EVT_ENCUMBERED)
            - ?     - gift idea: ghost-effect for survivors for X seconds (no outlines for SI) (even if running)
            - ?     - gift idea: see outlines on infected for X seconds ('telepathy')
            
            - ?     - investigate c1m1 elevator.. see if you can move it up instead and/or make an alternative
                      pathing using that (or the second elevator).
            
            - MAYBE - mini-scavenge for specific rounds (decide per map)
                        do the research (how well possible? how much work? has anyone done it already?)
            - MAYBE - when cars are done (a minimal amount of) damage, they have a chance to explode
            - MAYBE - random car alarms & randomly going off when survivors are near?
            - MAYBE - play merry go round music for CLOWNS event
            - MAYBE - add 'rerandom' function, working on live round [ for testing / bad starts ]
            
            - STAB  - related cvars -- lower spawn timers = more useful items, or something like that
                        [ not much point as this moment, apart as an appreciative gesture to stabs. ]
            
            - NO    - for random glows: decide /per survivor/ whether they have glows...
            - NO    - memorize horde timers, repeat same hordes for second roundhalf
            - NO    - random event speeds/times & random event horde size/duration
