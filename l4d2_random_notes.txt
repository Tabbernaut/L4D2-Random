L4D2_Random
===========

    event ideas:
    ------------
            
            in consideration
            ----------------
            - random sound replacements for SI? meh.
            
            in doubt
            --------
            
            rejected
            --------
            - 'pistol round': only pistols (magnums included). No locked doors and easier ci/si. [maybe]
            - weird SI: random SI abilities (CRox's code) -- just give every SI a random ability...
            
            
    to-do:
    ------ 
            - fix readyup -- make sausage commands and remove ad-text
            
            - bugfix:   spitter during tank -- on pass
            
            - bugfix:   weird intense colors on l4d1 common (valve bug?)
                        - there are NO l4d1 common without some sourcemod plugins...
                        - make cvar to enable/disable l4d1 common (just for l4d1 event)
            
            - low:      tentative idea: - scavenge finales (33% chance): is this possible?
            - low:      test and include stabby's random map stuff so people can launch random campaigns after loading random
            
            - maybe:    make commands for doing survivor anims (like nick scratching his nose)
            
            - gamedata: bwdefib (onrevived()) signature doesn't work for windows (can't fix for now :/)
            - later:    email Chet, see if maybe he likes Random at all...
            
    minor cleanup / details
    -----------------------
            - detail:   try different glow for hats (so they're easier to see) (but mustn't break outline workings) - try glowrangemin / glowrange combo
            - nitpick:  if I ever use g_bNoHealthItems beyond EVT_MEDIC, it will cause probs with PickRandomItem() as it is now.
            - nitpick:  fire extinguisher objects are stuck in wall - use angles of original item to place it further away (find correct angle and dist)
            - superlow: team randomizer function (!randteams) (use all players currently in teams, or include specs if less than required team size)
            - superlow: random team going first per round in versus. how? possible? worth the effort? no.
            - bugfix nitpick:   bots all get the same spawn in a vs game without humans - maybe a firstspawns thing?
            - nitpick:  can't see the special role's hat when he's ledged..
            - nitpick:  prevent two ammo piles spawning too close to eachother?
            - nitpick:  dark carnival 1 gas cans are not randomized.. (they're a point template, I guess)
            - nitpick:  gunswap event: survivors don't start with same weapons
            - glitch:   c10m3 is seen as 'a finale' (check separately?)
            - reminder: remove sm_voc / sm_voc_this commands for final version
            - code:     Clean up the l4d_drop copied code some more.
            - code:     "The SetEntProp functions have a parameter for the array index, use it instead of doing manual lookups and computing offsets."
    
    notes:
    ------
            - replacing models with SetEntityModel with survivors doesn't work well - animations are too important.
            - I tried the modelscale netprop, which worked sometimes. most of the time it glitched
              a LOT of things. It made some players practically immune to damage and so on. horrid.
    
    video:
    ------
        ...
        
    ideas:
    ------
            cvars?
                    sv_bounce
                    sv_glowenable       ?
    
            - ?     - gift idea: X second slowdown (like EVT_ENCUMBERED)
            - ?     - gift idea: ghost-effect for survivors for X seconds (no outlines for SI) (even if running)
            - ?     - gift idea: see outlines on infected for X seconds ('telepathy')
            
            - MAYBE - mini-scavenge for specific rounds (decide per map)
                        do the research (how well possible? how much work? has anyone done it already?)
            - MAYBE - when cars are done (a minimal amount of) damage, they have a chance to explode
            - MAYBE - random car alarms & randomly going off when survivors are near?
            - MAYBE - play merry go round music for CLOWNS event
            - MAYBE - add 'rerandom' function, working on live round [ for testing / bad starts ]
            
            - STAB  - related cvars -- randumb?
            
            - NO    - for random glows: decide /per survivor/ whether they have glows...
            - NO    - memorize horde timers, repeat same hordes for second roundhalf
            - NO    - random event speeds/times & random event horde size/duration
            
        event ideas:
            survivors have a random change to set things they shoot on fire
            15:38 - stabby: infected have a random change to create an inferno around them when they die
            15:38 - stabby: increased chance of ceda uncommons
            15:39 - stabby: everyone gets a fire axe
            15:39 - stabby: which also has a chance of setting things on fire

		19:51 - stabby: event idea: stalkers
		19:51 - stabby: hunters only
		19:51 - stabby: if the hunters are more than X units from a survivor, they are invisible to him
