L4D2_Random
===========

    event ideas:
    ------------
            
            in consideration
            ----------------
            - 'witch hunt': spawns many witches all over the place -- only way to score points = by killing them [pbonus]
                    consider it a 'miniwitches': give them 50% health, 50 dmg claw?
                    - how though, technically?
                        - just spawn a witch every 0.8 distance, from 0.1 to max 0.9
                    - no tanks during this
            
            in doubt
            --------
            
            - gnome VIP: only one gnome spawns (start saferoom), it must be brought or the end saferoom won't close
                or: gnome heaven, where the only way to score (many) points is to bring gnomes
                - for example: given only 1 gnome: distance points are frozen unless gnome is held
                
            rejected
            --------
            - 'pistol round': only pistols (magnums included). No locked doors and easier ci/si. [maybe]
            - weird SI: random SI abilities (CRox's code) -- just give every SI a random ability...
            - clockwork: clockwork timed spawns, deaths, rinse repeat (no tank?)
            - 'fallen survivor hunt'
            - quad damage [stab]
                one player gets special glow / sound => deals 4* damage
                tag-game: SI and survivors get quad, it switches when one hits another
                
            
    to-do:
    ------
            - bugfix:   fix campaign mode random:
                            - remove items that the survivors bring and use all items in the map? fix for events
            - bugfix:   multiwitch: message doesn't show for second team, only one witch spawned, though.
                        - cannot reproduce locally.
            
            - medium:   make separate 'randmap' config: with stabby's random map stuff.
            - low:      randomize hittables: if a car is positioned normally (not at a weird angle), give odds to replace with forklift or log?
            
            - low:      think of better boomcombo reward for groupies/women event
            - low:      make time penalty event work with pauses (and change its weight)
            
            - superlow: team randomizer function (!randteams) (use all players currently in teams, or include specs if less than required team size)
            - superlow: random team going first per round in versus. how? possible? worth the effort?
            
            
    minor cleanup / details
    -----------------------
            - glitch:   c10m3 is seen as 'a finale' (check separately?)
            - reminder: remove sm_voc / sm_voc_this commands for final version
            - code:     Clean up the l4d_drop copied code some more.
            - code:     "The SetEntProp functions have a parameter for the array index, use it instead of doing manually lookups and computing offsets."
            - code:     replace clunky map tries with a single map trie with flags-values
    
    video:
    ------
        ...
            
    harder paths
    ------------
    
        minor changes
        -------------
            c1m2        just some spawn cover changes (no harder map pathing, nor is it detected)
            
        path changes
        ------------
            c1m3        lower route + change to final area
            c2m4        blocked a few paths at start and before barns
            c3m3        some most-direct paths blocked
            c3m4        through house at start, roadblock in village
            c4m1        blocked path near garage sale, filled up road a bit
            c4m4        stabby's event
            c5m1        path forced halfway
            c5m3        different maze version (tougher), made house with hole (at ~50%) one-way-drop
            c5m4        forced pathing near end of map
            c8m1        forced long way around the map
            c8m4        harder pathing near reception
            c10m2       blocked routes near start and after event
            c10m4       added a bunch of obstructions in first parts of map
            c11m4       a number of small detours and spawn cover
            c12m2       forced routes, long way through building
            c12m4       my map changes / route change
            c12m5       cornfield changes
          

    FAQ's
    -----
        - I hate things like Buy- and Perkmods, incapped crawling, and RPG mods. Will I hate Random too?
        - I hate T2s and medkits, should I try Random?
        - Is Random ready for tournaments?
        - Does Random work with custom campaigns?
        - What is 'random' about Random?
        - I don't want to install confogl. How do I install Random for campaign mode only? 
        - Where is the source code for Random?
        
        
    ideas:
    ------
        
            - ?     - gift idea: X second slowdown (like EVT_ENCUMBERED)
            - ?     - gift idea: ghost-effect for survivors for X seconds (no outlines for SI) (even if running)
            - ?     - gift idea: see outlines on infected for X seconds ('telepathy')
            
            - ?     - investigate c1m1 elevator.. see if you can move it up instead and/or make an alternative
                      pathing using that (or the second elevator).
            
            - MAYBE:- do a per-map difficulty assessment for g_iDifficultyRating (just make it another trie)
                        - not sure about this yet...
                        - could be used to change odds of tank/witch etc...
            - MAYBE - mini-scavenge for specific rounds (decide per map)
                        do the research (how well possible? how much work? has anyone done it already?)
            - MAYBE - when cars are done (a minimal amount of) damage, they have a chance to explode
            - MAYBE - random car alarms & randomly going off when survivors are near?
            - MAYBE - play merry go round music for CLOWNS event
            - MAYBE - add 'rerandom' function, working on live round [ for testing / bad starts ]
            
            - STAB  - related cvars -- lower spawn timers = more useful items, or something like that
                        [ not much point as this moment, apart as an appreciative gesture to stabs. ]
            
            - NO    - for random glows: decide /per survivor/ whether they have glows...
            - NO    - memorize horde timers, repeat same hordes for second roundhalf
            - NO    - random event speeds/times & random event horde size/duration
            
            - CS:
                16:19 - ?²: how about, you plant a gnome on the ground
                16:19 - ?²: anywhere
                16:19 - ?²: takes about 15seconds
                16:19 - ?²: or 10 or something
                16:19 - ?²: when it's done it fizzles with a sparkle sprite or something
                16:19 - ?²: then launches into the sky with smoke
                16:20 - ?²: explodes into 10 pipebombs in every direction
                16:20 - ?²: "hold on guys let me gnome this area"
                16:20 - ?²: "too many zombies
