Random -- Special Events
========================

Each round has a fair chance of featuring a Special Event. If this happens, it will be announced along with the normal round information (that you can request with !rand).
Here's a complete list of the special events:


 1. Item Redundancy
-------------------
	One type of item, randomly picked, will be very common this round.

 2. Rush Hour
-------------
	There are a lot more common around and hordes are very large.
	There will be slower SI spawns to compensate.

 3. Common Holiday
------------------
	There are very few common around and hordes are very small.
	There will be faster SI spawns to compensate.

 4. Freakshow
-------------
	There are a lot of uncommon infected around.
	There will be slighly fewer common/uncommon infected around to compensate.

 5. Circus
----------
	Clowns. Are. Everywhere. I hope you like clowns.
	There will be slighly less common/uncommon infected around to compensate.

 6. Sorry, we're closed
-----------------------
	Many of the doors on this map are locked. A locked door can only be opened
	by destroying it, which can be done with melee weapons or explosives. You can
	also let infected break open the doors for you.

 7. Quadtastic
--------------
	There will be no spitters or boomers this round. Every attack is a potential
	quadcap.
	There will be slightly fewer common and slightly slower SI spawns to compensate.

 8. Bad Weather Day
-------------------
	There's a spot of stormy weather this round, like in Hard Rain.
	[ note: this is buggy and doesn't work on every map, alas. ]

 9. Fog of War
--------------
	There's heavy fog. To make it worse, survivors don't have outlines this round.
	[ note: this is buggy and doesn't work on every map, alas. ]

10. Land of Plenty
------------------
	There are a lot of items lying around this map.
	There will be slightly more common and faster SI spawns to compensate.

11. Marksmen
------------0
	The only primary weapons available this round are CSS snipers: Scout and AWP. Survivors
	start with Scouts.

12. It's Christmas
------------------
	There are many random gifts around.

13. Sudden Death
----------------
	Survivors start black and white and will die immediately if they are incapacitated. There are no medkits.
	There are, however, a lot of defibs around...
	The defib penalty is lowered to 5 points this round.

14. Adrenaline Rush
-------------------
	Survivors start bleeding out as soon as they leave the saferoom. They bleed out a bit faster than normally
	and there are no medkits to stop the bleeding. There aren't even pills - all the health items available are
	adrenaline shots (and the rare defib).
	The defib penalty is lowered to 5 points for this round.

15. No Heads-Up
---------------
	Survivors have no heads-up display (mainly the health bars on the bottom of the screen).
	Health and items can still be seen by opening the scores.

16. Old School
--------------
	L4D1-mode this round! Only L4D1 inventory items appear and only L4D1 special infected spawn.

17. Friendly Fire
-----------------
	Survivor friendly fire does triple the damage it normally does in versus games. (This is close to the Hard
	campaign level of FF.)
	There will be slightly fewer common and slightly slower SI spawns to compensate.

18. Hush
--------
	This event has two versions:
	1. All survivors become mute. They never utter or otherwise make any sound.
	2. All special infected become silent. Survivors had better keep their eyes open...
	   There will be slightly slower SI spawns to compensate.

19. Pickup Penalty
------------------
	Every time a survivor picks up any useful inventory item (pills, weapons, throwables, etc), their team
	loses 5 points.
	Type "!bonus" to see the current total penalty.

20. Health Penalty
------------------
	Every time a survivor uses a health item (pills, adrenaline, medkits and defibs), their team loses
	15 points.
	Type "!bonus" to see the current total penalty.

21. Shove Penalty
-----------------
	Every time a survivor shoves (m2's) a special infected, their team loses 15 points. Only shovable capping infected
	count (jockey, hunter, smoker), there are no penalties for shoving boomers or spitters.
	Type "!bonus" to see the current total penalty.

22. Magic Gun Swap
------------------
	There are no guns or ammo piles this round. Instead, each survivor is randomly handed a weapon
	with one clip's worth of ammo. When they empty their weapon, they get handed a new weapon, etc.

23. Mini-Tanks
--------------
	Many tanks will spawn this map. Luckily for the survivors, they're small and have low health (1350).

24. Keymaster
-------------
	A randomly assigned survivor is the 'keymaster', only they can use doors normally. Doors can still
	be broken with the usual tools.

25. Bad Combo
-------------
	All survivors start with a grenade launcher and a chainsaw. If they want any other weapon, they will
	have to find it somewhere further on in the map.

26. Babysitting
---------------
	One randomly assigned survivor is the 'baby', twice as vulnerable to special infected attacks.
	The other survivors are more resilient, but will have to protect the baby.

27. Encumbered
--------------
	The more stuff survivors carry, the slower they are. Best to travel light!
	Remember that you can always drop your active weapon/item with "!drop" (or sm_drop in console).

28. Booby Traps
---------------
	Randomly selected items and doors are booby trapped and may explode when touched. (Not necessarily equal between teams.)

29. Skeet Shoot
---------------
	There's a lot of hunters around. Survivors get 15 bonus points for skeeting them. Only full skeets (150+ damage in a
	single leap) count, but team skeets give bonus too.

30. Firepower
-------------
	No tier-1 weapons are available, only tier-2 and stronger.
	There will be more common infected and faster SI spawns to compensate.

31. Ammo Shortage
-----------------
	There's no ammo piles and weapons have very little ammo in them on pickup. Luckily, your team has a special ammo pack
	that can be deployed as an ammo pile. Hold the USE key to repack the pile as a carryable pack again. Be careful not to
	lose it, as you only get one for the whole round.
